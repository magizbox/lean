Based on his previous experience working in several U.S. startups, Ries claims that startups can shorten their product development cycles by adopting a combination of business-hypothesis-driven experimentation, iterative product releases, and what he calls validated learning. Ries' overall claim is that if startups invest their time into iteratively building products or services to meet the needs of early customers, they can reduce the market risks and sidestep the need for large amounts of initial project funding and expensive product launches and failures.\n\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\n\n2011, Eric Ries, The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses\n\n\n2012, Ash Maurya, Running Lean: Iterate from Plan A to a Plan That Works (Lean (O'Reilly)) 2nd Edition\n\n\n\n\nVideos\n\n\n\n\n2011, Eric Ries, \"The Lean Startup\" | Talks at Google\n\n\n\n\nCourses\n\n\n\n\nHow to Build a Startup\n\n\n\n\nPrinciples",
